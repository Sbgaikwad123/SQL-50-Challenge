# SQL 50 Challenge

Welcome to the SQL 50 Challenge repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About
This repository is dedicated to my personal challenge of solving 2 SQL questions daily and sharing the solutions here. 
By taking on this challenge, I aim to improve my SQL skills, tackle a variety of problems, and provide a resource for others who may be interested in SQL querying.

-------
Every day, I will post two SQL questions along with their solutions in this repository. Feel free to explore the solutions, suggest improvements, or even submit your own solutions via pull requests.


Check back daily for new challenges and solutions!

Happy querying! ðŸ’»
